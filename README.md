# Skin Smoothing
an efficient algorithm for skin smoothing implementation in c

## The algorithm steps are as follows
1.  detect skin color, adapt radius according to skin color ratio

2.  perform edge detection to obtain a edge map && smoothing level for apply skin denoise

3.  re-detect skin color based on the denoise results, filtered non-skin areas
